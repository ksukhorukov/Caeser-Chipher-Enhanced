She walks in beauty, like the nightOf cloudless climes and starry skies;And all thats best of dark and brightMeet in her aspect and her eyes;Thus mellowed to that tender lightWhich heaven to gaudy day denies One shade the more, one ray the less,Had half impaired the nameless graceWhich waves in every raven tress,Or softly lightens oer her face;Where thoughts serenely sweet express,How pure, how dear their dwelling-place And on that cheek, and oer that brow,So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,The smiles that win, the tints that glow,But tell of days in goodness spent,A mind at peace with all below,A heart whose love is innocent!
